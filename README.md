### Booklet Sources

The source of the booklet is contained within the file `booklet.odt` in the OpenDocument format (XML derived); the recommended editor is [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/). The document is written entirely in font [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter), under the SIL Open Font Licence.

### Prefixes

The prefixes are available within the `.xlsx` format, I convert them into `.csv` for further analysis. Actually, they are not grouped by, so for each entry `##A — ##Z` there is a row associated. Within the directory `/groupby` you can find the golang code for grouping all the ranges to an human-readable format.

## Work In Progress

* VHF and UHF band plans
* Digital Modes
* Physics chapter
* SOTA
